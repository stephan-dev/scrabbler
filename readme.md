# Scrabble

Programmer un jeu de scrabble en Ruby orienté objet (apprentissage OOP)
Test driven development : un fichier RSpec existe déjà et va tester notre programme, pour une seule lettre, pour un A, un Z, un mot, un mot compte double...
Création d'une class SrabbleWord avec une méthode score et une méthode multiplier_score.


## Setup 

1. Fork and clone (remember to clone YOUR fork).
2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Run `rspec`.

This will run several tests on the code in the `lib/scrabble_word.rb` file. The first time you run `rspec` all the tests will fail because there basically isn't any code in `lib/scrabble_word.rb`.

Your goal is to add code to `lib/scrabble_word.rb` such that all the tests pass. Until you get to the bonus, **there is no need to modify any files except `lib/scrabble_word.rb`**. 

If you've never played the game Scrabble before, you may want to ask your neighbor about the rules of the game and how words are scored.

## Prompt

* Define a class named ScrabbleWord with an `initialize` method that takes one argument, `word`, and stores it in an instance variable `@word`.

* Write a "getter" for this instance variable `@word` that returns the word as a lowercase string.

* Define a method `.score` that returns the scrabble score of the word.

* Define a method `.multiplier_score` that takes a multiplier as an argument and returns a multiplied value of the score. (Think double or triple word score.)

Here are the letter values. Think about how you might put this data in a usable format for your methods above.

```
a: 1, b: 3, c: 3, d: 2, e: 1,
f: 4, g: 2, h: 4, i: 1, j: 8,
k: 5, l: 1, m: 3, n: 1, o: 1,
p: 3, q: 10, r: 1, s: 1, t: 1,
u: 1, v: 4, w: 4, x: 8, y: 4,
z: 10
```
